## Abstract
The sponge city theory has played an extremely important role in urban planning and construction, comprehensive management of rain and flood, and development of green ecological cities. However, the reconstruction of the pipelines in the sponge city is complex, and the transformation process has big conflicts, low efficiency, and poor linkage among departments, which indirectly increases unnecessary costs and construction time. This article is devoted to the deep analysis of the problems in the construction of Sponge City, combining GIS (geographic information system), VR (virtual reality) and BIM (building information model) technologies, and exploring whether these technologies can solve the problem of design, construction and management of sponge cities. This technology can realize early detection of design (construction) problems and large-area linkage management and reduce construction costs while improving the construction and management efficiency of Sponge City.
